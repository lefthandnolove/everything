record and arrange everything!	{#welcome}
=====================

------------------
introduction:
----------------------

a web system which could write down almost everything.

> I want to record **#the thing#** that I "was doing/will do(like todo, but not exactly)/todo/memo/" in 1 place

> it even can be used as todo list, diary, and blog system, and to imagine, I want to use it as a simple project and bug management system, so when I'm working on private projects which I can't afford 7$ on github, I can use this system to manage the project

**Contributes** your codes and let's make it happen
